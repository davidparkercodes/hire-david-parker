# Development Rules for hiredavidparker

## Workflow

-   Always create feature branches for new work
-   Make atomic, well-described, but single line commits
-   Create pull requests for code review before merging to main
-   Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
-   NEVER include authorship or generated by in commit messages or PR descriptions
-   NEVER include "Generated with..." in commit messages or PR descriptions
-   ⚠️ NEVER RUN `cargo run` DIRECTLY! It will launch a TUI application that cannot be safely interrupted

## Code Quality

-   Follow Clean Code principles
-   Write self-documenting code that expresses intent clearly
-   NEVER add any double forward slash // comments, except in test files
-   Avoid all unnecessary comments; code should be self-explanatory
-   Only use comments when absolutely necessary to explain "why" not "what"
-   Use descriptive variable and function names
-   Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
-   Maintain consistent code style across the codebase

## Testing

-   Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices
-   Write tests before implementing functionality
-   Always add both unit and integration tests for new features
-   Maintain high test coverage
-   Ensure all tests pass before submitting PRs

## Rust Best Practices

-   Follow the Rust API Guidelines
-   Use proper error handling (Result, Option) instead of panics
-   Keep functions pure when possible
-   Leverage Rust's type system for safety
-   Use cargo fmt and cargo clippy to maintain code quality

## Documentation

-   Document public APIs using rustdoc comments
-   Keep README and other documentation up to date
-   Use examples in documentation when appropriate
