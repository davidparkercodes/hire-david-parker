## Why I Want to Join Warp

I've been a terminal power user for years, but I've always felt that
terminal technology hasn't evolved with modern UX expectations. When I
discovered Warp, I was thrilled to see a team tackling this problem
head-on.

**What excites me about Warp:**

* **Vision**: Reimagining the terminal for modern developers
* **Technology**: Rust's performance and safety for terminal applications
* **UX Focus**: Bringing modern interface design to the terminal
* **Innovation**: Not just incremental improvements, but rethinking fundamentals

I'm enthusiastic about contributing to this mission and helping build
the next generation of terminal experiences that developers love to use.
