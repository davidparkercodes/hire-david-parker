Hi Warp team! I'm David Parker, a Full Stack Developer, Software Architect, and huge fan of Warp. I love what you all are doing with the terminal, and I would love to be a part of the journey!

I've been building all sorts of things with software since the 6th grade. I'm self-taught and always hungry to learn more. A large part of my career was as a Freelance Web Developer, then I got into building software, then started working full-time for a company a few years ago as a Full Stack Developer, where I am currently a Software Architect at.

I'm a huge fan of AI, and strongly agree with you all about Prompt-Driven Development. The terminal is the perfect place to interact with AI, and I would be pumped if I helped build this best-in-class terminal experience you all are building!

I'm on the newer side of rust, but being a lifetime learner who has worked on a ton of different projects, I am confident I could start contributing very quickly. I hope this interactive resume and the other apps I've built for this application reflect that. I can both code line by line or leverage AI. I have a very strong understanding of core programming principles and feel extremely confident when pairing that existing knowledge with the latest tools in AI.

Working in the web space for as long as I have, I have lots of expertise in UI/UX, and building experiences that users really enjoy. I've been involved in many conversations with stakeholders, to product owners, to developers of all skill levels, and have no problem speaking with anyone -- whether it's text, voice, video, or in-person.

Give me any task and I will find a solution and deliver. I am genuinely very passionate about software development and solving problems. I'm very open to take-home challenges, and would welcome the opportunity to show you what I can do. Or to get on a call and chat more to see if I would be a good fit.

Thanks for taking the time to read this!
