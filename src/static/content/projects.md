The below apps were specifically built for this application.

### Interactive Terminal Resume (Rust)

A terminal resume to standout from most othe resumes, that also shows that I understand the terminal and can build apps in Rust.

### AI Code Analyzer (Rust)

A command line tool that analyzers code and codebases, leveraging Rust's speed and built-in concurrency to do it very fast. It also has AI integration to help with code analysis. I see a lot of potential for this if built out more. I would love to tell you some of my ideas and see if they could be features for Warp.

### Warp Theme Creator (Python)

A simple Python app that helps create Warp themes. Key feature is it will take a screenshot of a website and use that to build a theme. Also has a --prefer-light and --prefer-dark flag.

### Warp Commands Navigator (TypeScript/Node.js/Next.js)

I had started this full stack app, that scrapes the commands.dev website and builds out another way to navigate and find Warp Workflows, but I did not get it to a point where I was happy with it to send to you all. I didn't want to delay sending my application any longer.
